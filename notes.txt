so iteration is similar to recursion
but based on the question we can use recursion

when you call a function then it creates a layer in stack ok and then the sout and recursive call
so when the recursion is finished then it comes back to the main function

“When recursion calls itself, it doesn’t run the code after the call immediately. It first goes deeper into recursion. Then when it comes back (returns), it continues with the remaining lines in the previous stack frame.”
so have to solve subsequence,uniquesubsequence as well as the keyboard problem .
